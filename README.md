  - Haskell

## Fizzbuzz

Write a program which for all numbers from 1 to 100

 - prints `Fizz` when the number is divisible by 3
 - prints `Buzz` when the number is divisible by 5
 - prints `FizzBuzz` when divisible by 5 and 3
 - otherwise just prints the number

## Moin

### Iterative

Write the program using an iterative algorithm.

### Recursive
